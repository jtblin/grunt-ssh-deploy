# grunt-ssh-deploy: simple deployment via SSH

> deploy the local project via SSH

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-ssh-deploy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-ssh-deploy');
```

## The "deploy" task
Your remote server target folder for deployment has following layout:

```shell
/path/to/deploy +
                |
                |- current -> symlink to ./releases/<timestamp> #last deployment
                |
                |- releases +
                            |-<timestamp1> 
                            |
                            |-<timestamp2>
```       
### Setup

Please create a folder named `mkdir releases` under your deploy target folder. A setup task is not yet provided.

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `deploy` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  "ssh-deploy": {
    liveservers: {
      options:{
        servers: [{
          host: '123.123.123.12',
          port: 22,

          // usage with user/password authentication
          username: 'username',
          password: 'password'

          // usage with SSH Agent forwarding
          agent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK
        }],
        cmds_before_deploy: ["some cmds you may want to exec before deploy"],
        cmds_warmup: ["some cmds to be executed before symlink is switched to new deployment result"],
        cmds_after_deploy: ["forever restart", "some other cmds you want to exec after deploy"],
        deploy_path: '/path/to/deployment',
        // list of folders and files that should be excluded from deployment
        exclude_list: ['./node_modules/*', './private'] 
      }
    }
  },
})
```
###Current Execution Order
1. create new folder under releases/
2. zip local project folder with exclude parameters
3. upload tgz file to remote
4. execute warmup commands on remote machine etc. restarting services, delete fragments
5. switch symlinks to new folder 
6. execute local cleanup
7. execute post commands on remote host
8. close connection

###Authentication
currenty password authentication via username and password and agent SSH agent forwarding is possible. 
With SSH agent forwarding your personal keys can be used for authentication but host aliases are currently not supported
Please see documentation of [node-SSH2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) plugin.

### Debugging
You can have a look inside every step that is executed by using `grunt deploy --debug`
All local and remote STDOUT and STDERR output will be shown on the console.
